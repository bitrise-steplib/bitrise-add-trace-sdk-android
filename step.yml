  dependency (trace-sdk) and applies plugin (trace-gradle-plugin) if project not already have them. This step is needed,

      summary: Additional task options for "injectTrace" and "verifyTrace" tasks
      description: |
        Step uses a Gradle task called "injectTrace" to add the required dependencies to the project. Also uses
        "verifyTrace" to verify "injectTrace". For debugging purposes you may want to add additional flags to them, it
        would display useful information if you have any issue with the step.

        Examples: "--stactrace", "--info" or "--debug" (without the quote marks).

        Note: Multiple entries should be separated with a whitespace character.

        Example: "--stacktrace --info" (without the quote marks).
